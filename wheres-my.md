# where's my?

IOT: "hey google/siri/alexa, where [name of the item]"

Hey!

- where is my phone?

- where is my laptop?

- where is my wallet?

- where are my keys?

- where is my lighter?

- where is my x item?

1. the phone is the master device listens for the sound and sends the
   notification to the right device. Same as you can say 'Hey Siri, where are
   you?'

2. all of the devices have small device with endpoints:

- healthz
- play sound for a short bit

3. The devices are nano-computers + thing, or actual devices (there would be an
   app that registers all of the devices and keeps track of the connected ones.

4. The devices would only need to be on the same network.

This could even work as a helpful feature on airtags, airpods and other
products plays 'Bop bop bop' sound on phone.

Even though it is really simple, everyone loses things at home sometimes.
Especially when you are running late this might be frustrating. It literally
happened to me that I lost my belongings at home lol.
